###########MAJOR DRAWING MODE##################################################

# Drawing mode
# 0: Pencil Sketch (The Shroud)
# 1: Decals  (Stamps)
# 2: Line Art (Squiggle)
drawMode 0

###########Pencil Sketch (The Shroud) Parameters###############################

#Colour or grey level (Triagle Mode is just under GrayScale Mode, is NOT colourfull)
# 0: Gray Scale
# 1: Colour full Scale
colourMode 1

#Parameters for both grey level and colour(****But the fast convergence does not work in Triangle Mode***, just leave it as a slow at this Mode)
# Convergence rate
# 0: slow convergence
# 1: fast convergence -- sometimes TOO fast
fastShroud 0

#Which shape do you like to draw for rendering?
# 0: line
# 1: triangle
shape 1

#Which Triangle would do you prefer to draw for rendering?(This option is just for Triangle **NOT** for the line)
# 0: empty triangle
# 1: fill triangle
typeTriangle 1 

# Line lenght to use (for rendering line just it uses the firstLineLength parameter, not secondLineLength!!)
# At the Triangle mode is better to use the length of lines less than 100 for Swiss chess and Empty Triangle, otherwise it took ages to render
# (even you set as "0" at Triangle Mode, again does not give you a quick rendering, because the lines of triangle must be inside of the canvas.)
# For Fill triangle does not have this problem so you can provide lien length as "0" or even very larg one. 
firstLineLength 50
secondLineLength 30

#Parameters for grey level only
# Canvas background color
canvasBG 255

# Pixel replacement -- what to do if writing a pixel that has already been (This option is for Lines & just Fill Triangle[Not Empty triangle])
# 0: Blend the colours (Combined pixels)
# 1: Don't draw the new pixel (It says if the stroke has got same color with a canvas do NOT draw anything again on that pixel)It is not Implemented for triangles
# 2: Don't draw the entire stroke (if even one pixel is same on the canvas with the stroke, Do not write that image at all(line or triangle))
# 3: Stop drawing the stroke (if any pixel of image reached to the another image on the canvas, stop to draw rest of the image.)
pixelReplacement 0


#Parameters for colour only
# Canvas background color (ColourFullcale)
