###########Pencil Sketch (The Shroud) Parameters###############################

# Colour or grey level (Triagle Mode is just under GrayScale Mode, is NOT
# colourfull)
# 0: Gray Scale
# 1: Colour full Scale
#colourMode 1
# NOTE: (perry) There is no 'colourMode' anymore. Drawing in colour is default behaviour. If you want to use gray scale then use gray targets and gray palettes

# Parameters for both grey level and colour(****But the fast convergence does
# not work in Triangle Mode***, just leave it as a slow at this Mode)
# NOTE: (perry) What?
# Convergence rate
# 0: slow convergence
# 1: fast convergence -- sometimes TOO fast
fastShroud 1

# Which shape do you like to draw for rendering?
# 0: line
# 1: triangle
shape 1

# Which Triangle would do you prefer to draw for rendering?(This option is just
# for Triangle **NOT** for the line)
# 0: empty triangle
# 1: fill triangle
typeTriangle 1 

# Line lenght to use (for rendering line just it uses the firstLineLength
# parameter, not secondLineLength!!)
# At the Triangle mode is better to use the length of lines less than 100 for
# Swiss chess and Empty Triangle, otherwise it took ages to render
# (even you set as "0" at Triangle Mode, again does not give you a quick
# rendering, because the lines of triangle must be inside of the canvas.)
# For Fill triangle does not have this problem so you can provide lien length
# as "0" or even very larg one. 
firstLineLength 50
secondLineLength 30

# Pixel replacement -- what to do if writing a pixel that has already been
# 0: Blend the colours (Combined pixels)
# 1: Don't draw the new pixel
# 2: Don't draw the entire stroke
# 3: Stop drawing the stroke
pixelReplacement 0

# Canvas background color
canvasBG_R 255
canvasBG_G 255
canvasBG_B 255

# Colour update Method (Use if Fastshroud is turned on)
# 0: best channel
# 1: whole pixels
