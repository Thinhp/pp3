Manage-VPAC-runs is designed to enable you to carry out NPR and
MOSAIC runs on a VPAC super computer without having to learn the VPAC
operating system and job submission language.

To use Manage-VPAC-runs you must have a VPAC account.  Please contact
vic.ciesielski@rmit.edu.au if you do not have an account.

Manage-VPAC-runs assumes that you have set up your local computer to
carry out the run you want.  Clicking "New" will copy the necessary
files from your computer to VPAC and start the run.  When the run
is finished you must click "Copy" to copy the output files from the
job to your local computer.  After you have done this, your local
computer will be in the same state as if you had carried out the run
on it.  [*** With one exception, see below.]  

The comment field is intended to help you keep track of the runs.  For
example, "coloured lines, depth 7"

The table of jobs is only updated after you click "Update".  You need
to do this whenever you want to get the latest progress of jobs
running at VPAC.

If you want to see how a run is progressing, you can click on "Peek".
This will copy the last frame written to the png directory to your
local computer and display it in a pop-up window.

If you find that a job is not running as expected you can kill it by
clicking "Cancel".

When you have copied all you need from the VPAC run you can remove the
output files by clicking "Delete".

***The files in the png directory are not copied because there could
be many megabytes of images.  If you want a copy of these files,
contact vic.ciesielski@rmit.edu.au.
